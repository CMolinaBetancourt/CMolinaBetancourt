# 👋 Hi! I'm Catherine

I am a Full-Stack Developer from Colombia, now living and enjoying the beauty of British Columbia, Canada. As a full-stack developer, my passion is to create technological solutions that provide value to businesses and clients, and help businesses prosper and grow. 

I have a versatile background in project management, marketing, and customer service. My technical skills include NestJS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, React, Next.js, and TypeScript. For over 14 years, I was immersed in the business world, leading projects and gaining a comprehensive understanding of every aspect of a company to drive productivity improvements. I learned to develop my strategic vision, build teams, and share a common goal 🤝, something I value more than ever today.

I saw web development as the perfect opportunity to combine my experience with tech. This led me to pursue a four-month intensive bootcamp with over 800 hours of code, after which I became a Full-Stack Developer 🎓. I've recently started a new relationship with coding, and I'm happy to be getting hands-on with development, discovering wonderful things about this impressive world and its vibrant tech community. Now, I am ready to join a team where I can continue learning, contribute my vision, and achieve big, challenging goals!🚀
