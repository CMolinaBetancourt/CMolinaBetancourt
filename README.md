# 👋 Hi! I'm Catherine

A full-stack developer from Colombia, now living and enjoying the beauty of British Columbia, Canada. After many years coordinating projects in other fields, I've recently started a new relationship with coding. I'm happy to be getting hands-on with development, discovering wonderful things about this impressive world and its vibrant tech community.
